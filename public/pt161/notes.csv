Chris

I appreciate the insight and the teaching that you provide each day in the Simpler Options chat room.  Would you please provide me the inputs you use to set up the MACD indicator you use? I was able to set up the orange line but I was not able to get the blue line shown in your plot.

Thank you.
Mike

1,2016-02-16 15:41:40,Introduction to our services. ,Note,2016-02-16 15:41:40,1410153,64644,2016-02-16 15:41:40,"Here are the links to our sites where you can sign up and check out our daily videos. 

The daily videos are free. They are short and concise market analysis on Stocks, ETFs, Options, Futures and Forex trading. Most people start out watching the free videos to get a feel for how these guys see the markets and how they trade them on a day to day basis. 

Exposing your self at least a little bit each day will help you build a feel for how to look at a few stocks or what ever you wanna trade. Once you build that familiarity you will start to be able to make a call on what you think is gonna happen and the rest is history.  

We have a lot of content to offer for free to get you familiar with trading. The free daily videos are great to start with. 

Here are the links to the sites where you can find out more about the traders and what they do everyday to do this for a living. 

www.simplerstocks.com

www.simpleroptions.com

www.simplerfutures.com

www.simplerforex.com

www.fibonacciqueen.com

It'll seem like a ton and probably overwhelming as well but think about it like this. They have all been doing this for over 20 years so if you get exposed to now you will build that intuition pretty quick and from there will always be learning more and more about how to get better at managing the risk involved. Start by signing up for the free videos and check them out for a while. 

Let me know if you have questions or anything and Ill do my best to get you the information you need.
